## UI notes

Initial screen should display:
- Welcome message
- AOV (value)
- total revenue (value)
- Median and p95 for Delivery days (value)
- Return rate (value)

And provide menu items for opening the graphs:
- 1) revenue by day (table and graph)
- 2) revenue by week (table and graph)
- 3) Return rate by category (table and graph)
- 4) Orders count by category and subcategory (table and graph)

And the last option is the custom query functionality?
- 5) Create custom query
